# Homepage title motion and branding

Scope: landing route `/` only. Standalone Events, Schedule, Merchandise, Sponsors, Team, Gallery and Contact pages are not edited. The supplied navbar logo is selected only on `/`; other routes retain their existing brand mark.

## Current interaction

There is no pause/parallax button. The existing comic rails loop automatically behind the title. The background is made from local comic images, not a video. Off-screen/hidden animation is suspended to save work, and OS reduced motion is respected.

Scrolling down preserves the existing `YUVAAN` zoom, while `ENTER THE` and `VERSE` shrink and move vertically outward (up/down) from the center. Scrolling back up restores the close, centered stack. All three lines share one centered red comic cloud based on the supplied cloud.jpeg reference. The isolated cloud has a transparent exterior, scalloped black outline and lower-right speech tail; all title text remains live HTML. Extra vertical room contains the outward-moving labels throughout their bounded motion. The comic background again zooms and shifts with scrolling at its previous strength (desktop: extra scale 0.32 / travel 96 px; mobile: 0.14 / 42 px). A smoothstep depth curve softens the beginning and end of the background response. Its continuous rail animation runs independently. Only the foreground lettering animates; the title container, splash and CTA stay in fixed positions in normal document flow. Lower-page section headings, cards and content have no added scroll transforms or reveal translations.

## Adjustments

- `components/home/HeroSection.tsx`: `HERO_MOTION.desktop.brandGrowth` / `preludeShrink` are both 0.22; mobile values are 0.14 / 0.18. Scale ranges are 1–1.22 for YUVAAN and 1–0.78 for ENTER THE on desktop, with smaller mobile ranges. Scroll progress is bounded and eased in requestAnimationFrame without React state updates.
- `components/home/HeroSection.module.css`: defines text transform origins, spacing, splash dimensions, continuous comic animation and reduced-motion rules. Comic panels move at 42 layout pixels per second; their duration is derived from the repeatable sequence height. The decorative cloud image is positioned around its body rather than its tail; max-width: none overrides the global image reset so it can safely surround the title.
- `app/page.tsx`: renders sections directly, keeping ordinary scrolling and stable content layout.
- Navbar logo source: user-supplied `logo.jpg`, copied to `public/brand/yuvaan-logo.jpg`. Next Image serves an optimized small rendition.

## Cloud artwork

Replace `public/brand/hero-cloud-red.png` to change the cloud. Its current intrinsic size is 1537 × 1023 with true alpha; Next Image serves responsive optimized renditions. Keep transparent margins and a similar body/tail placement, or adjust `.bubble` in the hero stylesheet. The image was edited with the built-in image generation tool, using `/Users/tsinha/Documents/YUVAAN/img/cloud.jpeg` as the source. The exact edit prompt is saved in [hero-cloud-prompt.txt](hero-cloud-prompt.txt).

## Verification

The hero motion tests verify the unchanged YUVAAN scale, outward/shrinking satellite lines, reverse-scroll restoration, mobile bounds, absence of a pause button, reduced-motion gating and cleanup. The existing marker-trail tests continue to pass. Production build includes TypeScript checking. Desktop and mobile browser checks verify no horizontal overflow, stable title/container positioning and automatically playing comic rails. Physical touch-device frame pacing remains a device check.
